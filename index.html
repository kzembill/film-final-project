    <h2>Why A Christmas Story stole 
        <br />
        the hearts of many</h2>
    <h3>"He looks like a Pink Nightmare"</h3>
   
    <p>
        The infamous tale of a young boy's fight to get a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas. 
        This movie 
        is full of nostaglia, lauighter and heart. 
        It is a film that will stand the test of time.
        Many generations have been raised on this movie during the holiday season.
        The tongue on the 
        flagpole, the tripple dog dares, the Scott Farcus we all had in our life; 
        it all has a 
        place in our hearts, making it a pop classic. And the bunny costume, 
        Oh, Lord,
        the bunny costume, and the infamous leg lamp. This movie is full of 
        catchy one-liners and memorabilia.
        <em>"FRA-GI-LE, it must be Italian"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        A Christmas Story got where it is because of TV, and it’s not hard to see why. 
        The movie made its TV debut on HBO in 1985, then slowly made its way toward channels more people had, 
        popping up on WGN and Fox on either Thanksgiving night or the night after Thanksgiving a few times before 
        eventually making its way into the hands of the Ted Turner empire, where it was destined for great things. 
        Even in the ’90s, TV ratings were beginning the long process of splitting into smaller and smaller niches, 
        and networks of all shapes and sizes understood that one of the vital pieces of any year-round ratings puzzle were holiday specials. 
        TNT and TBS bet big on A Christmas Story, showing it more often every year, until arriving at the day-long marathon on 
        TBS that will air again this year beginning Tuesday night. The networks took a good movie that people had responded to and turned it into an event, 
        even as NBC was limiting Wonderful Life airings to one or two per year. A Christmas Story became the de facto American Christmas movie and hasn’t looked back.

            <h4>The Andy Warhol Museum</h4>
            <p>Located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the place of Andy Warhol’s birth, 
                The Andy Warhol Museum holds the largest collection of Warhol’s 
                artworks and archival materials. We are one of the most comprehensive single-artist 
                museums in the world and the largest in North America.</p>
                <h5>Address:</h5>
                <p>117 Sandusky St, Pittsburgh, PA, United States, 15212</p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>I immediately felt ispired when I walked into the high ceiling entryway with a 
                    magnificent floor to ceiling image of one of Warhol's works. The vibe was of the 50-70s 
                    era and who doesn't love those times? With their vibrant use of color and works 
                    of Warhol's that take up 7 floors, this is a place where you will find inspiration and 
                    feel as if you have gone back to this time. Apparently he was a film maker as well and several floors 
                    display these films.
                    Go check it out for yourself!

                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>Lucille Ball was an idol to so many, but especially young women. I used to sit wide-eyed infront of the television
                    in awe with seeing her in action during a scene. She is a woman of beauty, comedic genius, pioneer and fierce business woman.
                    This museum will allow you to immerse yourself in what she built; going back in time to where it all began.

            <h4>A Christmas Story House</h4>
            <p>A Christmas Story House, now restored to its movie splendor, is open year round to the public for tours and overnight stays. 
                Directly across the street from the House is A Christmas Story Museum, which features original props, costumes and memorabilia 
                from the film, as well as hundreds of rare behind-the-scenes photos. Among the props and costumes are the toys from the Higbee’s window, 
                Randy’s snowsuit, the chalkboard from Miss Shields’ classroom and the family car. After reliving A Christmas Story at Ralphie’s house don’t forget 
                to visit the museum gift shop for your own Major Award Leg Lamp and other great movie memorabilia. You can even shop through our online gift shop here. 
                Proceeds from the gift shop and overnight stays help support and maintain A Christmas Story House & Museum</p>
                <h5>Address:</h5>
                <p>3159 W 11th St. Cleveland, OH 44109</p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>The warmth and nostalgia that is felt while you are watching this movie is immediately felt when you walk onto that porch. That porch with the 
                    leg lamp on display for all to see. The living room is decorated just as it is in the movie, with the fire truck and blue bowling ball with 
                    green wrapping paper. The phone upstairs is the cherry on top. When you put your ear to the phone, you hear Mrs.Shwartz screaming on the other end.
                    Want to really get nostalgic? For a hefty fee (but worth-it) you can your family can stay in the home overnight. Maybe Christmas Eve?
                    Check it out!

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am a film enthusiast who in my older years became obsessed with art; the two bring me so much joy.
            I grew up watching the screen as if it was going to take me to that place and moment in time;
            half the time I think it did.
