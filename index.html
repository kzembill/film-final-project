        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am a film wnthusiast who in my older years became obsessed with art; the two bring me so much joy.
            I grew up watching the screen as if it was going to take me to that place and moment in time;
            half the time I think it did.

        <h3>About this webiste</h3>
        <p>I created this page because I have always loves these pop culture icons. I have visited two out of the three of these museums; highly recommended if you are a fan. 
            Even if not, this is great opportunity to xpand your mind through art and your heart through nostalgia.
